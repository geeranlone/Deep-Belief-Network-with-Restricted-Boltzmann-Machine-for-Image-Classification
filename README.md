# Deep Belief Network for Image Classification

This project implements a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for classifying images, utilizing TensorFlow and other essential libraries. The notebook demonstrates pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the model.

## Project Structure

- **Model1_DBN_ipynbd.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Deep Belief Network.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies to install.
- **.gitignore**: File to ignore unnecessary files in the GitHub repository.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/geeranlone/Deep-Belief-Network-with-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-for-Image-Classification.git)
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to execute the model.

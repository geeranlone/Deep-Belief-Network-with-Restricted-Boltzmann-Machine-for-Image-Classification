# Deep-Belief-Network-with-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-for-Image-Classification
This project implements a Deep Belief Network (DBN) integrated with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for image classification tasks. The DBN leverages RBMs for unsupervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning with supervised learning.
